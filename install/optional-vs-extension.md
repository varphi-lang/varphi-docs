# (Optional) VS Extension

Varphi also has an official [Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=varphi-lang.varphi) available on the Visual Studio Marketplace. You can use this extension to run and step through Varphi programs from within the Visual Studio Code IDE in a more graphical format. The only prerequisites are

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [The Varphi Interpreter](./)
