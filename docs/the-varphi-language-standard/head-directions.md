# Head Directions

In Varphi, head movement directions are represented using uppercase letters:

1. `L` : Move left
2. `R` : Move right

{% hint style="warning" %}
The characters "l" and "r" (lowercase "L" and "R") are not interpreted as "left" and "right" by the lexer, and will result in a syntax error.
{% endhint %}
