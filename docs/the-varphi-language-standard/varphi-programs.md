# Varphi Programs

Varphi programs are extemely simple. They consist of [lines](lines.md), separated by newlines. They can also include [comments](comments.md).

Varphi supports both deterministic and [nondeterministic Turing programs](../turing-machine-theory/nondeterministic-turing-machines.md). Nondeterministic programs have two or more lines with the same condition, but with different instructions.
